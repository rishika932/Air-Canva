🌬️ Air Canvas – Draw in the Air with Python!

Air Canvas is a Python-based project that allows users to draw in the air using hand gestures, leveraging OpenCV, Mediapipe, and NumPy. This project uses computer vision techniques to track hand movements and create a virtual canvas where you can draw without any physical contact—just move your fingers, and the magic happens!

✨ Features
✅ Real-time hand tracking using Mediapipe Hands

✅ Virtual drawing with different colors and brush sizes

✅ Gesture-based eraser and clear-screen functionality

✅ Smooth and optimized tracking for a seamless experience


📌 Technologies Used
Python

OpenCV (Computer Vision)

Mediapipe (Hand Tracking)

NumPy (Image Processing)

🚀 How It Works
Run the script, and your webcam will start tracking your hand.

Use your index finger to draw on the screen.

Change colors using predefined gestures.


Use the thumb & index pinch to erase or clear the canvas.
